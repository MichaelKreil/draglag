# DragLag

All touch devices have a certain amount of lag â€“ the time it takes for the
device to recognise and process your touches.
DragLag is meant to be a simple tool for finding out how far touch events
lag behind the actual touch in a web browser.

Just start dragging across the screen at a constant speed. Three semicircles
at 50-millisecond intervals will appear around the position where your browser
reports your touches. The semicircle that intersects the actual position of
your finger gives you the approximate lag of your touch events.
